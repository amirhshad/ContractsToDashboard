# Clausemate Marketing Strategy

## Market Opportunity

The contract management software market is valued at **$3-4 billion in 2025** and projected to reach **$5-12 billion by 2030-2035**, growing at **12-17% CAGR**. This is a rapidly expanding market with strong tailwinds:

- **70%+ of enterprises** are adopting automation to reduce manual contract errors
- **Cloud deployment dominates** (68-77% market share)
- **SMBs are the fastest-growing segment** with double-digit growth
- **AI integration** is now a key differentiator (extracting clauses, flagging risks, predicting renewals)

## Competitive Landscape

### Enterprise Leaders (expensive, complex)
- **Icertis** - $250M+ ARR, enterprise-focused
- **DocuSign** - $3B+ revenue, primarily eSignature
- **Agiloft, Ironclad, Sirion** - Large enterprise CLM

### Our Opportunity Gap
The market is dominated by **expensive enterprise solutions**. SMBs need:
- Simpler onboarding (not 6-month implementations)
- Affordable pricing (not $50K+/year contracts)
- AI-powered analysis without enterprise complexity

**Clausemate's positioning**: "AI contract intelligence for growing businesses" - filling the gap between manual spreadsheets and enterprise CLM.

### Key Messages by Persona

**Operations Manager:**
> "Stop tracking contracts in spreadsheets. Clausemate automatically extracts key dates, costs, and terms from your PDFs."

**CFO/Founder:**
> "See exactly what you're spending across all vendors. Get alerts before auto-renewals hit your credit card."
